    Ensure absolute sealing and contamination control with our inflatable FBC (Fluid Bed Coater) gaskets. Designed specifically for pharmaceutical and food processing equipment like Fluid Bed Dryers (FBDs) and Fluid Bed Coaters, these gaskets provide a cycle tube-like seal when inflated. This creates a highly effective, leak-proof barrier that prevents powder spillage and cross-contamination, ensuring product purity in sterile environments.

  subTitle: |
    Our FBC gaskets are manufactured to the highest standards of quality, using food and pharmaceutical-grade materials that are compatible with CIP and SIP sterilization processes. When pressurized, the gasket inflates to form a perfect seal, accommodating minor irregularities between sealing surfaces. When the pressure is released, the gasket deflates, allowing for easy disassembly and cleaning. This unique design eliminates bacteria traps and ensures maximum hygiene.
