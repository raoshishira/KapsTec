    Our TC sanitary gaskets are manufactured to meet the most stringent regulatory requirements, including FDA and USP Class VI standards. This ensures they are suitable for CIP (Clean-in-Place) and SIP (Steam-in-Place) sterilization processes. By creating a smooth, secure barrier between Tri-Clamp ferrules, these gaskets eliminate bacteria traps and potential sources of contamination, safeguarding product purity and process reliability.
