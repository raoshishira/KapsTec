    content:
      "We supply Gear Couplings from PLA-NET SRL, Italy, one of the best Gear Coupling manufacturers in the World. The PLA series couplings are engineered to transmit medium to large power between industrial equipment shafts, compensating for misalignment due to bending, thermal expansion, or foundation settling. Their barreled toothing ensures a larger contact area, optimal load distribution, and high reliability.",
