    content:
      "The KapsTec PLA series (powered by Pla-net) gear couplings are engineered for the transfer of medium to large power between industrial equipment shafts. Specifically designed to compensate for connecting shaft misalignment due to bending, thermal expansion, or foundation settling, these couplings absorb expansion and axial movements without generating abnormal stress. Featuring barreled toothing for a larger contact area, they ensure optimal load distribution and high reliability.",
